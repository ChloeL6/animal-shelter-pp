## Description

_ 1. Create a new web page for an animal shelter. List out the animals available to be adopted, including pictures and descriptions of each animal. Have at least 3-5 animals listed. Don't forget to set up a git repository, make frequent commits and push to a remote repository on GitHub.
2. Display each animal's "profile" in a column.
3. Change the styles of elements nested within the columns using the idea of cascading.
4. Find other places in your web pages where you can change elements on the page according to cascading precedence.
5. Center some elements on the page._

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
